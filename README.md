# Govern: Complete democracy, for all

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

This is where I'm starting on work for a system called "Govern" which provides a way for
delegate-based representative democracy, and potentially complete, direct democracy.
It's mostly just dreams and stuff right now, but please feel free reach out and provide feedback!

## Structure

This is a monorepo, and more information on the components can be found in their individual
directories, which each have README files of their own.

## Project planning

The project is being tracked and managed [publicly on Trello](https://trello.com/b/T6SpDvkR).
