# Contributing to Govern

Govern is a fully open source system, and all bug reports, ideas, and especially PRs are welcome.
To contribute, first be sure that you read the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as it is 
strictly enforced. Then you can follow the below guidelines so that you can get caught up with the
team ASAP!

## Reporting issues

Before reporting a new issue, please search GitHub to see if anyone else has reported the same
thing (or something substantially similar). If so, please leave a comment on that issue rather than
opening a new one. That will ensure your particular concern is seen sooner!

## Sharing ideas

All ideas are very much appreciated! Please open a GitHub issue with the label `enhancement`, and
we'll open up discussion on it.

## Pull requests

Yay, code! Check out the [DEVELOPMENT](./DEVELOPMENT.md) doc to get your development environment
up and running, then send us your awesome code!
