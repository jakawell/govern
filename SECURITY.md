## Supported Versions

This is oh so pre-release, so nothing is "supported" yet, but please report any issues you suspect (see below).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While is is pre-release, please just file reports as issues here on GitHub. I don't have an anonymous option yet, but since it's pre-release, you should be good.
